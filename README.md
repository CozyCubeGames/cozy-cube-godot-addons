# Cozy Cube Godot Addons
These Godot addons were made for internal use by Cozy Cube Games for the upcoming VR game, 🐧Penguin Festival🐧. They are provided for public use as-is, free of charge.

## Disclaimers

## Basic Instructions
Take any addons you need from here and put them in the addons folder of your Godot project.

Basic info for each addon can be found in the `plugin.cfg` file in each folder. Many of the addons have example scenes which contain additional info.
